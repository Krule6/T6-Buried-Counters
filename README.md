## T6-Buried-Counters

This repository includes scripts that track RNG events of the Buried Easter Egg Speedrun:

  - BofaCounter.gsc – Tracks how many times the player has acquired both the Paralyzer and Time Bomb.

  - GamesSinceBofa.gsc – Keeps count of how many games have been played since the last getting Paralyzer and Time Bomb.

  - VultureAidCounter.gsc – Tracks the amount of times the player has acquired Vulture Aid as a free perk from the witches

The counters will only reset to 0 when a player quits plutonium.
