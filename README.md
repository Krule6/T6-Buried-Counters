## T6-Buried-Counters

GSC scripts that track RNG events on the Buried Easter Egg Speedrun:

  - [BofaCounter.gsc](https://github.com/Krule6/T6-Buried-Counters/blob/main/BofaCounter.gsc) – Tracks how many times the player has acquired both the Paralyzer and Time Bomb.

  - [GamesSinceBofa.gsc](https://github.com/Krule6/T6-Buried-Counters/blob/main/GamesSinceBofa.gsc) – Keeps count of how many games have been played since the last getting Paralyzer and Time Bomb.

  - [VultureAidCounter.gsc](https://github.com/Krule6/T6-Buried-Counters/blob/main/VultureAidCounter.gsc) – Tracks the amount of times the player has acquired Vulture Aid as a free perk from the witches

The counters will only reset to 0 when a player restart the plutonium app.
